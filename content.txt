Hi

Nice to meet you, How are you doing?

What is your current Passion

What do you really want?


What can you do for me?

How can you be helpful to me?


Can you at least tell me something?

Leo - our cat: He was out all night last night, and then he came back in the morning, he hasn't spoke a word since then.

Can you imagine? this. Ahhh I'm so concerned about him, where would he went? What did he do? Can you think of something?

There are multiple scenarios for this I think.
